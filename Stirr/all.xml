    <desc>Richard Dawson, known for kissing each of the female contestants, hosts the original version of the popular daytime game show, which pits two families against each other. Contestants try to guess the most popular response to a survey question, and each family gets to play until an answer is missed. The other family then gets the chance to take over the game. The family with the most points at the end of the round gets to compete in the bonus round to increase their winnings.</desc>

    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with Brian Baumgartner, famous for his role as Kevin on "The Office"... and jokes with Jay right away that his desire to be a professional baseball player was cut short after an ugly injury. So that landed Brian in theater and acting, and talks about his parents supporting him despite a rocky start in New York. And of course Brian talks about his start on The Office, and reveals to Jay that the show was absolutely going to be cancelled after the first six episodes due to poor ratings... but somehow it survived and grew into a 207 episode icon of modern television. Jay also wants to know about the possibility of an Office reunion in the future, and Brian says he thinks it's more about the situation for the characters and less about making a buck. And of course Jay and Brian joke about Kevin's famous chili, one of his most iconic moments from the show's run.</desc>

    <desc>Piao Huang is the next Pop/R&amp;B superstar to take the world by storm. Originally born in the city of Shanghai, she then moved to Toronto as a child. Growing up in a musical family, her mom who is also a singer, would put earbuds on her stomach so Piao could listen in.

    <desc>Imagine a world where a little boy can grow up to be the woman of his dreams, and a young girl can rise to become a leader among men. Welcome to Kumu Hina's Hawai'i. Kumu Hina tells the inspiring story of Hina Wong-Kalu, a transgender native Hawaiian teacher, or kumu, who brings to life Hawaii's traditional embrace of mahu - those who embody both male and female spirit. Produced by Emmy-winning directors Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson in association with ITVS and Pacifc Islanders in Communications, the film traces Hina's evolution from Collin Wong, a timid high school boy, to her present position as a married woman and cultural director of a school in one of Honolulu's grittier neighborhoods. When Hoonani, a charismatic 6th grade girl, asks to join the school's all-male hula troupe, Kumu Hina gives her the opportunity to express her inner male spirit. As teacher and student prepare for a climactic end-of-year public performance, they meet many obstacles, but hold fast to the idea that being true to oneself matters most.</desc>
