    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <title>Nappy Boy Radio with T-Pain</title>
    <desc>Atlanta's very own EarthGang stopped by to chat with T-Pain about exactly what they've been up to during the pandemic. Olu (AKA Johnny Venus) and WowGr8 (AKA Doctur Dot) get into it as they sip on their custom cocktails. J. Cole's basketball stint left them wondering are athletes able to crossover into music the same way musicians are able to crossover into sports? Listerine is definitely repurposed floor cleaner. WowGr8 confesses to watching HGTV (on YouTube nonetheless) and they get into the Caucasian appeal of rock legend Lenny Kravitz. Who are your top five groups of all time and why doesn't it include the Jedi Council? Check out this absolutely bonkers episode of T-Pain's Nappy Boy Radio Podcast!</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with the owners of NeverAsh Cigars, Steve and Tom, to talk about the art of cigar making and how their business evolved organically from their love of cigars. Steve also jokes about the wild way he met his cigar affiliate in the Dominican Republic and how that lead to them creating their own cigar brand. Tom also discusses how he quit his full time IT job over the vaccine mandate, and decided to go all in on the cigar business to try and set an example for his daughter. Jay also wants to know about how the cigars are reliably sourced in the Dominican Republic, and Steve and Tom talk about their culture and how precise their cigar process really is regardless of how many cigars they order. They also talk about how their cigars are made, what goes into them and the great care and attention that the rollers pay to every cigar they roll. This is a huge show for cigar lovers!</desc>
